A simple WEBGL music visualization application made with p5.js

To start, run the index.html file. 

Press the play button to start playing music track, and watch as the graphics animate according to the audio file.
There are navigation icons at the top of the application, including a help menu (which also can be accessed by pressing H). 

The first icon on the navigation tab brings up the graphic settings menu (also accessible by pressing S), which allows for slight customizations of the current graphical visualization, like colour and speed.
